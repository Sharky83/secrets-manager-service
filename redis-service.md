# Redis Service

This document describes how to use Redis as a backend service in the microservices architecture.

## Purpose
Redis is used for caching, pub/sub messaging, and fast data storage. It is not a microservice, but an external service that other microservices can connect to.

## Usage in Microservices
- Microservices connect directly to Redis for caching, session management, or pub/sub.
- Redis should be run as a separate container in your development and production environments.

## Running Redis in a Container
See the instructions below for running Redis using Docker Compose.

## Security
- Protect Redis with strong passwords and network restrictions.
- Avoid exposing Redis directly to the internet.
